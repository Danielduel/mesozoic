### A generic build system for Deno web apps.

## What does it do?

Mesozoic takes your source files from `root`, copies those source files to
`output` (preserving your project directory structure), transforms your
JavaScript/TypeScript with [swc](https://swc.rs/), transforms your stylesheets
with [Lightning CSS](https://lightningcss.dev/) and writes those resulting
transformations to your `output` directory.

## API

You can build your own bespoke build system on top of Mesozoic, which
[Ultra.js](https://ultrajs.dev) is currently doing.

```ts
import { Builder } from "https://deno.land/x/mesozoic@v1.0.0-alpha.43/mod.ts";

const builder = new Builder({
  root: "/absolute/path/to/source",
  output: "/absolute/path/to/output",
  importMapPath: "./importMap.json",
  compiler: {
    minify: true,
    sourceMaps: false,
    jsxImportSource: "react",
  },
  name: "mesozoic",
  logLevel: "INFO",
});

/**
 * Setup your entrypoints, relative to "root".
 * A module graph will be built for each entry point defined.
 * Remote dependencies will also be independently fetched and output,
 * into each entry points "vendorOutputDir" at ./vendor
 */
builder.setEntrypoints({
  "./client.tsx": {
    vendorOutputDir: "browser",
    target: "browser",
  },
  "./server.tsx": {
    vendorOutputDir: "server",
    target: "deno",
  },
});

/**
 * Ignore files from the build, relative to "root".
 * Any file that matches the provided patterns won't be copied to the build output directory.
 */
builder.setIgnored([
  "./README.md",
]);

/**
 * Files which should have their contents hashed and added to the filename,
 * great for long term caching (https://web.dev/use-long-term-caching/)
 */
builder.setHashed([
  "./src/**/*.+(ts|tsx|js|jsx|css)",
  "./public/**/*.+(css|ico|jpg|png|svg|gif|otf|ttf|woff)",
]);

/**
 * Files which should be compiled by SWC, usually TypeScript or files with JSX.
 */
builder.setCompiled([
  "./**/*.+(ts|tsx|js|jsx)",
]);

/**
 * Clean the output directory
 */
await builder.cleanOutput();

/**
 * Gather all source files from the root
 */
const sources = await builder.gatherSources();

/**
 * Copy the files to the output directory
 */
const buildSources = await builder.copySources(sources);

/**
 * Execute the build
 */
const result = await builder.build(buildSources);
```
